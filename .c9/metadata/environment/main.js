everything is made of objects.","//And a function is also an object.","//Because of this, it can be parsed as a parameter, or argument, to another function.","//And at its simplest, that's what a callback is: a function that's parsed as a parameter to another function and executed inside that function.","//Callbacks are used a lot in JavaScript, especially in jQuery, which we'll come onto later.","//You've already seen examples of callback functions, too, when we were learning Jasmine.","//And we're going to write a callback function that will be called when our data variable contains response text.","//But why not just use timeouts like we did in our last video?","//Well, one of the problems with having to set timeouts in our code is that we'd have to tell our system to wait every time we wanted something to happen.","//And it could take different amounts of time depending on different circumstances, such as network speed.","//So let's take a look at a way we can get around that using a callback.","//So I'm going to take away my data variable, and, instead, I'm going to create a new function called \"getData\".","//Then I'm going to move all of the code that we use for our xhr request into that function.","//So I'll highlight it and then press ctrl+shift+B, or command+shift+B on the Mac, just to beautify our code and get the indents right.","//We can take out the \"setTimeout\" function here now too because we don't need it anymore.","//So I'm going to use the parameter here, the argument, of \"cb\".","//\"cb\" standing for callback, and this will be the function that we parse in.","//When I then use cb on line 9 here, that's going to actually run the function that we parse in as a callback.","//So for this to work, we need to invoke a getData method with a function.","//So let me write one here inside the parentheses. This is an anonymous function.","//And it's just going to say \"console.log(data).","//So I also need to parse data in as a parameter inside the braces here.","//So when this runs, what it will do is parse itself in as a function.","//That function will be executed here with this as the data argument.","//So let's save this code now.","//And I'm just going to run it, and we'll see what happens.","//So as we can see, the data has been logged to the console, which is exactly what we would expect.","//Now the reason we don't need to set a timeout here is because we are explicitly invoking our getData function.","//We're checking to see if our readyState is 4 and the status is equal to 200.","//And at that stage, we're then invoking our callback function that we parsed through as an argument.","//So what this basically means is that when our script gets to this point, it's going to run the function that we parsed in to getData as an argument.","//And this just gives us more control within our code base.","//What we could also do instead of actually writing the function inside the brackets for getData, is we could write a separate function.","//So I'm going to create a new function called \"printDataToConsole\".","//Again, that's going to take in \"data\" as an argument.","//And as before, that's going to console.log the data.","//Now inside the brackets, when I'm calling my getData function, I'm going to parse in the \"printDataToConsole\" function as an argument.","//And notice I don't put the opening and closing brackets because I'm parsing in the actual function itself.","//Okay, let's try that.","//And on line 15, I have a colon instead of a semicolon. Let's just remove that.","//Run it.","//And there's our data once again.","//So as you can see, callback functions are very useful.","//They get around the problem of having to use timeouts.","//They still allow us full control over our data because they're only invoked when we actually want them to be.","//So in this unit, we've looked at how to speak to our API using JavaScript.","//We've seen how to get our response text back as a string and how to turn it into JSON format.","//We've looked at different readyStates and HTTP status codes.","//And finally, we've seen how to use both timeouts and callback functions to get our data displaying when we want it to.","//Now that we know how to get the data and how to parse it, let's start doing something useful with it."],"id":304}],[{"start":{"row":0,"column":0},"end":{"row":19,"column":1},"action":"insert","lines":["const baseURL = \"https://swapi.co/api/\";","","function getData(type, cb) {","    var xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();","","    xhr.onreadystatechange = function() {","        if (this.readyState == 4 && this.status == 200) {","            cb(JSON.parse(this.responseText));","        }","    };","","    xhr.open(\"GET\", baseURL + type + \"/\");","    xhr.send();","}","","function writeToDocument(type) {","    getData(type, function(data) {","        document.getElementById(\"data\").innerHTML = data;","    });","}"],"id":305}],[{"start":{"row":19,"column":1},"end":{"row":20,"column":0},"action":"insert","lines":["",""],"id":306},{"start":{"row":20,"column":0},"end":{"row":21,"column":0},"action":"insert","lines":["",""]}],[{"start":{"row":21,"column":0},"end":{"row":21,"column":1},"action":"insert","lines":["?"],"id":307},{"start":{"row":21,"column":1},"end":{"row":21,"column":2},"action":"insert","lines":["?"]}],[{"start":{"row":21,"column":1},"end":{"row":21,"column":2},"action":"remove","lines":["?"],"id":308},{"start":{"row":21,"column":0},"end":{"row":21,"column":1},"action":"remove","lines":["?"]}],[{"start":{"row":21,"column":0},"end":{"row":21,"column":1},"action":"insert","lines":["/"],"id":309},{"start":{"row":21,"column":1},"end":{"row":21,"column":2},"action":"insert","lines":["/"]}],[{"start":{"row":21,"column":2},"end":{"row":69,"column":73},"action":"insert","lines":["In this unit, we're going to bring all of this back into the context of our HTML website.","We have our data printing to the console.

well.","//So we have a little bit of work to do when unpacking this data.","//The first thing we need to do, then, is determine how to access it.","//So this time, we're going to use a \"console.dir\".","//\"dir\" stands for directory.","//We're going to parse in our data.","//And this will allow us now to browse through the object and to see its format.","//It's going to print it

Luke Skywalker down to Obi-Wan Kenobi at the end.","//We also have a URL called \"next\".","//That's for pagination, so we just show 10 items at a time.
