And then I parse in the URL, which in this case is \"http://www.swapi.co/api/\". And now I use xhr.send().","//Then we have the xhr.open() method, and the first argument that we parse in is \"GET\". Now there are several different methods that we can use to communicate with a web server. The two that you're going to use most often are GET and POST. The GET method is used when we're retrieving data from the server. This is a standard one that a browser users when retrieving a web page. POST is used when we're sending data to the server, such as an uploaded file or form data. Since in this instance we want to retrieve data from the Star Wars API, then we're going to use the GET method. The second argument is the URL that we want to retrieve. So, in this case, it's \"http://swapi.co/api/\". We're making a request to the Star Wars API. ","xhr.open(\"GET\", \"https://swapi.co/api/\");","","//And then we do xhr.send() to send the request.","xhr.send();","","// onreadystatechange function. whenever the state changes of our xhr object, we want to run a check. If the ready state is equal to 4 and the status is 200, then what we want to do is use JavaScript to do document.getElementByID() and retrieve our data div. And then we're going to change the innerHTML to be equal to the response text that comes back from our xhr object.","// The main chunk of what's going on in this piece of code is in this onreadystatechange() function. The xhr object maintains an internal state as it's completing various parts of our request operation. And \"readyState = 4\" means that the operation has been completed. So if we go to Google and type in xhr readyState, we can see that in the Mozilla Developer Network, we have some documentation. That lists the five different states. 0 means that open() has not been called yet. 1 means that the open() method has been called. A readyState of 2 is that send() has been called. 3 means that the responseText now has some data in it. And 4, the one that we are checking for, is that the entire operation is complete. So in our code, we're checking to see that everything has completed. Then we're looking at an HTTP status code. The HTTP status code of 200 means \"OK\". Other common HTTP status codes can be seen here. 301 for instance, means moved permanently. 401 is \"Unauthorized\". 403, \"Forbidden\". 404, one of the most common ones that we see, is \"Page not found\". The page that we're looking for doesn't exist at this location. And 500, which we can often see, is \"Internal server error\", where something has gone wrong with the server. So the HTTP status code of 200 means \"request succeeded, content delivered'. That's what we're checking for in our function here.","// So once everything is okay, we then use some JavaScript to getElementById() from the DOM and change its innerHTML to the response text that comes back from our xhr object.","xhr.onreadystatechange = function() {","    if (this.readyState == 4 && this.status == 200) {","        document.getElementById(\"data\").innerHTML = this.responseText;","    }","};","","//what we've seen is that the data coming back is a string.

This is an anonymous function.","And it's just going to say \"console.log(data).","So I also need to parse data in as a parameter inside the braces here.","So when this runs, what it will do is parse itself in as a function.","That function will be executed here with this as the data argument.","So let's save this code now.","And I'm just going to run it, and we'll see what happens.","So as we can see, the data has been logged to the console, which is exactly what we would expect.","Now the reason we don't need to set a timeout here is because we are explicitly invoking our getData function.","We're checking to see if our readyState is 4 and the status is equal to 200.","And at that stage, we're then invoking our callback function that we parsed through as an argument.","So what this basically means is that when our script gets to this point, it's going to run the function that we parsed in to getData as an argument.","And this just gives us more control within our code base.","What we could also do instead of actually writing the function inside the brackets for getData, is we could write a separate function.","So I'm going to create a new function called \"printDataToConsole\".","Again, that's going to take in \"data\" as an argument.","And as before, that's going to console.log the data.","Now inside the brackets, when I'm calling my getData function, I'm going to parse in the \"printDataToConsole\" function as an argument.","And notice I don't put the opening and closing brackets because I'm parsing in the actual function itself.","Okay, let's try that.","And on line 15, I have a colon instead of a semicolon. Let's just remove that.","Run it.","And there's our data once again.","So as you can see, callback functions are very useful.","They get around the problem of having to use timeouts.","They still allow us full control over our data because they're only invoked when we actually want them to be.","So in this unit, we've looked at how to speak to our API using JavaScript.","We've seen how to get our response text back as a string and how to turn it into JSON format.","We've looked at different readyStates and HTTP status codes.","And finally, we've seen how to use both timeouts and callback functions to get our data displaying when we want it to.","Now that we know how to get the data and how to parse it, let's start doing something useful with
