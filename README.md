## Name of Project: Star wars API

Using video tuition I have built a small app to pull information from the Star Wars API and to display it for the user in 
tables. Although I was guided through this project by videos, I think it is worth putting in my portfolio to show my gradual 
skill increments in back end data driven web development and the use of APIs. This app looks simple in the browser but the 
back end coding was quite challenging.
